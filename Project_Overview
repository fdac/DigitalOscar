Based on interest in movies and my discovery of the Rotten Tomatoes API, I present:

I found an API for rotten tomatoes that looks very usable; its link is below.

http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/docs


From this I could pull a critic rating, viewer rating, critic consensus, Mpaa rating, actors, year produced, etc. 
I think there could be some really interesting analysis on the most commonly used words in the critic consensus for a given
critic rating and viewer rating.  Also, it would be interesting to see the most stable actors and most changing actors based 
on movie ratings.  


A big idea for this project would be to create a prediction model to predict movie earnings based on the information gained
from rotten tomatoes and match it to how much money it grossed.  Unfortunately, rotten tomatoes does not have the grossed or 
budgeted money information.  I found this source that appears reputable, although I'm not sure how I would pull this information
from the website (sourced below).
